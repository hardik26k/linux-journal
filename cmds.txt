#GNU Debugger short for gdb

#apport-unpack is used to unpack a .crash file (from /var/crash directory) into a new directory
$apport-unpack crashFile.crash newDirectoryForCrashFile

apport-unpack systemGeneratedCrashReportPath.crash yourNewUnpackDirectoryHere

cd yourNewUnpackDirectoryHere/

gdb `cat ExecutablePath` CoreDump (pay attention to tildes here!)

bt (output actual back-trace)

Note: apport-unpack will sometimes crash itself on unpack operation (apport seems broken all around... xD), but your CoreDump and other files will be there, just ignore it and delete all .crash files in /var/crash after you move them elsewhere in order to allow system to output new crash reports from same apps there.
